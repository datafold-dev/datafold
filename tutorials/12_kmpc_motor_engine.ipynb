    "In this tutorial, we will lift nonlinear dynamics of a model representing a motor engine into a higher dimensional space where it's evolution is approximately linear. The Koopman operator is extended to controlled dynamical systems. To compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator, we use Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). Essentially, this ledas to a linear controlled dynamical system, which we use in for model predictive control (MPC). "

In the first scenario, there are no constraints imposed on the output and the objective is to track a piecewise constant reference. In the second scenario, we will impose the constraint of $y ∈ [−0.4, 0.4]$ and track a time-varying reference of $y_r(t) = 0.5\\cos(2\\pi t/3)$, which may violate the output constraint during some part of the simulation period.
