    "# Data structure for time series collections `TSCDataFrame` \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the `TSCDataFrame` data structure, which is designed to handle time series collection data. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that contain multiple time series. For instance, a system might have been sampled multiple times with different initial conditions, or there could be missing samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TSCDataFrame` is primarily used for input/output specification of data-driven methods in the *datafold* package, and its implementation can be found in the sub-package pcfold.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TSCDataFrame` is a subclass of the popular DataFrame data structure from the pandas project. This means that it inherits all the rich functionality of `pandas`, making it easy for users familiar with `pandas` to specify their collected data. However, `TSCDataFrame` restricts the more generic `DataFrame` to a structure with certain guarantees to organize the time series collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of using `TSCDataFrame` is that it makes it easy to work with collections of time series data. Users can easily manipulate and analyze their data using the powerful tools provided by *pandas*. For those who are new to working with `DataFrame`s, we refer to the main *pandas* [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for a broader introduction. In this tutorial, we will focus on the specific context in which `TSCDataFrame` is useful."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a way to generate one-or-many time series, let us generate and then collect two of them into a `TSCDataFrame` object. In general, we can create a new instance of `TSCDataFrame` in the same way as we would instantiate the superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TSCDataFrame(data, index, columns, **kwargs)` \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when initializing a `TSCDataFrame`, there are specific requirements which may need to be fulfilled on the `data`, `index` and `columns` arguments to successfully create the new object. Otherwise, there will be an `AttributeError`. The special requirements of `TSCDataFrame` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements on `data`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only numeric data is allowed (e.g. no strings or other objects). \n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements on `index`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The row-index must have two levels (i.e. be a `MultiIndex`). The first index level is for the time series ID and the second level for the time values within each time series.\n",
    "* The time values must be sorted per time series\n",
    "* The time series IDs must be positive integers, and the time values must be non-negative numerical values. \n",
    "* No duplicate names are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements on `column`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The index only suppors a single level.\n",
    "* The column names must be unique.\n",
    "* No duplicate names are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
