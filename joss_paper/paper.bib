	abstract = {A method is presented to treat complex experimental flow data resulting from PIV. The method is based on an appropriate combination of higher order singular value decomposition (which cleans the data along the temporal dimension and the various space dimensions) and higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), a recent extension of standard dynamic mode decomposition that treats the data in a sliding window. The performance of the method is tested using experimental data obtained in the near field of a zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jet. The better performance of HODMD is put in evidence making this technique suitable to both, cleaning the experimental noise using a limited number of snapshots and obtaining robust and sufficiently accurate results that elucidate the spatio-temporal structure of the flow. The results show that this ZNMF jet is temporally periodic in the near field, where the flow results from the interaction of a large number harmonics. These harmonics involve large scale spatial flow structures, identified as spatially growing instabilities, which are associated with the flow transition to turbulence in the far field.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear manifold learning algorithms, such as diffusion maps, have been fruitfully applied in recent years to the analysis of large and complex data sets. However, such algorithms still encounter challenges when faced with real data. One such challenge is the existence of {\textquotedblleft}repeated eigendirections,{\textquotedblright} which obscures the detection of the true dimensionality of the underlying manifold and arises when several embedding coordinates parametrize the same direction in the intrinsic geometry of the data set. We propose an algorithm, based on local linear regression, to automatically detect coordinates corresponding to repeated eigendirections. We construct a more parsimonious embedding using only the eigenvectors corresponding to unique eigendirections, and we show that this reduced diffusion maps embedding induces a metric which is equivalent to the standard diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach on synthetic data sets. We then apply our algorithm to data collected from a stochastic model of cellular chemotaxis, where our approach for factoring out repeated eigendirections allows us to detect changes in dynamical behavior and the underlying intrinsic system dimensionality directly from data.},

	abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

	abstract = {The diffusion maps together with the geometric harmonics provide a method for describing the geometry of high dimensional data and for extending these descriptions to new data points and to functions, which are defined on the data. This method suffers from two limitations. First, even though real-life data is often heterogeneous , the assumption in diffusion maps is that the attributes of the processed dataset are comparable. Second, application of the geometric harmonics requires careful setting for the correct extension scale and condition number. In this paper, we propose a method for representing and learning heterogeneous datasets by using diffusion maps for unifying and embedding heterogeneous dataset and by replacing the geometric harmonics with the Laplacian pyramid extension. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate how the learning process becomes straightforward when the constructed representation smoothly parameterizes the task-related function.},

The extension process that we describe involves the construction of a specific family of functions that we term geometric harmonics. These functions constitute a generalization of the prolate spheroidal wave functions of Slepian in the sense that they are optimally concentrated on X. We study the case when X is a submanifold of Rn in greater detail. In this situation, any empirical function f on X can be characterized by its decomposition over the intrinsic Fourier modes, i.e., the eigenfunctions of the Laplace{\textendash}Beltrami operator, and we show that this intrinsic frequency spectrum determines the largest domain of extension of f to the entire space Rn. Our analysis relates the complexity of the function on the training set to the scale of extension off this set. This approach allows us to present a novel multiscale extension scheme for empirical functions.},

The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},
